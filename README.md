# Shroom hunters

This is a fictional 'shroom (mushroom) hunting company in some fictional town in the US. It allows 'shroom hunters to connect with local 'shroom hikers and partner with local companies that offer camping and biking equipment for rent. It includes information about partner eateries where your day's 'shroom collection will be used to prepare your meal. Additionally, this website maintains a database of local attractions, with historical information and geolocation services.

Caveat: This is a contrived site created solely for me to learn backend infrastructure, so it is not complete nor is the information accurate.  Please do update your dependencies, before using the code written in this repo.
